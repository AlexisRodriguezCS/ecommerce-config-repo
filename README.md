# üóÇÔ∏è Config Repo ‚Äì E-commerce Backend

This repository stores configuration files for all microservices in the e-commerce backend.  
It works with the Spring Cloud Config Server to deliver the right config values to each service at runtime.

Each environment (like `dev`, `test`, or `prod`) can have its own settings ‚Äî making it easy to manage configuration in one central place.

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                       # Documentation of the config repo structure
```

- Each service has its own folder with default and environment-specific files
- Profile-specific files (-dev, -test, -prod) enable environment-specific overrides

## üîß Usage

Microservices connect to the Config Server using a local `bootstrap.yml` like:

```yaml
spring:
  config:
    import: optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888
```

At startup, services load:
- The global `application.yml`
- Their own `application.yml`
- Their active profile overrides (e.g., `auth-service-dev.yml`)

The Config Server fetches configuration from this repo and delivers it to the services.

---

## üîÅ Configuration Loading Example

Fetching configuration for `auth-service` with the `dev` profile:

```bash
GET http://localhost:8888/auth-service/dev
```

The following files are merged in order:

1. `application.yml` (global)
2. `auth-service/application.yml`
3. `auth-service/auth-service-dev.yml`

## üèõÔ∏è Configuration Management Flow

### Local (Each Microservice)

| File            | Purpose                                           |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `bootstrap.yml` | Connect to the Config Server and declare service name |
| `application.yml` | (Optional) Used only for local overrides or testing without Config Server |

### Config Repo (`ecommerce-config-repo/`)

| File                                    | Purpose                                  |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `application.yml` (root)                | Global shared settings for all services  |
| `{service-name}/application.yml`        | Default settings per service             |
| `{service-name}/{service-name}-dev.yml` | Dev environment overrides                |
| `{service-name}/{service-name}-prod.yml`| Prod environment overrides               |

### Config Server (`ecommerce-config-server/`)

| File            | Purpose                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `bootstrap.yml` | Connect to the Git config repo          |

## üß† How Configuration Is Resolved (Step-by-Step)

When a microservice (e.g., `auth-service`) starts up, it retrieves its configuration from this central config repository through the Spring Cloud Config Server. Here's how the process works:

### üîÅ Configuration Resolution Flow

1. **Microservice Startup**  
   The service (e.g., `auth-service`) starts and loads its own `bootstrap.yml`, which contains the URL of the Config Server.

2. **Request to Config Server**  
   It sends a configuration request to the Config Server (e.g., `http://localhost:8888/auth-service/dev`).

3. **Config Server Bootstraps**  
   The Config Server reads its own `bootstrap.yml`, which points to this Git repo (`ecommerce-config-repo`) as the source of truth.

4. **Git Repository Fetched**  
   The Config Server clones or pulls this repository.

5. **Global Configuration Loaded**  
   The root-level `application.yml` is always loaded first. This contains shared config (e.g., logging, actuator, tracing) applied to all services.

6. **Service Configuration Loaded**  
   Then, the service-specific file (`auth-service/application.yml`) is loaded.

7. **Profile-Specific Configuration (Optional)**  
   If a profile is active (like `dev` or `prod`), the corresponding file (`auth-service-dev.yml`) is loaded next.

8. **Merge and Override**  
   The configurations are merged in this order:
   - Global `application.yml` (lowest priority)
   - Service-level config
   - Profile-specific config (highest priority)

9. **Final Config Sent to Service**  
   The merged configuration is returned to the microservice, which uses it to initialize database connections, ports, RabbitMQ settings, and more.

    K --> L["Service Applies Config (DB, RabbitMQ, etc.)"]

```

### üõ†Ô∏è Why This Matters

Centralizing configuration this way allows:
- Consistent environment management (`dev`, `prod`, etc.)
- Separation of concerns ‚Äî services don‚Äôt hardcode credentials
- Easy config updates via Git version control
- Immediate visibility for observability and logging settings

## üîê Secrets & Security Roadmap

This project is evolving its approach to secrets management. Here's how it's handled across different stages:

### ‚úÖ Right Now (Development)
- Example values (like `authuser` / `authpass`) are stored in config files for local testing
- These are **not real secrets** ‚Äî just placeholders for dev use

### üîú Coming Soon (Staging)
- Move real secrets (like database passwords) out of config files
- Use **Docker Secrets** or `.env` files to pass in sensitive info securely

### üöÄ Future Plans (Production)
- Use a secure tool like **HashiCorp Vault** to store and manage secrets
- Load secrets automatically during deployment using CI/CD
- Add strict access rules and track who accesses what
